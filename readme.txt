This project is a very simple chat made with a tkinter - in the chat you can log in as a user just with a name that doesn't already exist, and create a room and the 
room's id is the same as your name. other users can join the room and message everybody else in the room. When all of the users exit the room, the room is deleted
and when a user exit his id is not save nor the messages in the room are saved (when a user joins he can't see the messages before he joing)

the project took a few days
